Usage: ./lacells-creator <options>

Options:

  -d, --download
          Download towers_(...).csv from OpenCellID and Mozilla Location
          Services. Make sure to set API_KEY to the OpenCellID API Key.
          You can do this once a day (for OpenCellID).

  -i, --import
          Import towers_(...).csv into the lacells.db file. When lacells.db
          is already present, it is moved to lacells.db.bak first.

  -c[<MCC>], --filter-mcc[=<MCC>]
          Only keep records in lacells.db that have the specified MCC
          (mobile country code). Use comma-separated list for multiple.
          When no MCCs are given, the default configuration's MCC is used.

  -m, --merge
          Merge records from duplicate cell towers in lacells.db.

  -p, --push, --push-now
          Upload lacells.db to mobile phone using adb. When using --push-now,
          the prompt asking if the phone is ready is skipped.

  -e, --export
          Export lacells.db to CSVs per MCC to lacells/lacells-mcc_xxx.csv
          and a country summary in lacells/lacells-countries.{csv,geojson}.

  -C <file>, --config <file>
          Read configuration file. If this option appears multiple times,
          files are loaded in order, before all other command-line options.

  -h, --help
          Show this help message.

  -q, --quiet
          Don't tell what's happening, only report errors.

Configuration:

  The default user configuration is read from ~/.config/lacells/creator.cfg
  and the file gen_lacells_conf or creator.cfg in the script's location.
  After that, any configuration files specified on the command-line are read.

  A configuration file can set variables in use by the script. Usually, you
  would set API_KEY to the OpenCellID's key, and MCC to a comma-separated
  list of mobile country codes.
  For all possible options, please see misc/creator.cfg.

Examples:

  Download, import, filter on Zimbabwe, merge and push to mobile:
     API_KEY=xxx ./lacells-creator -d -i -c648 -m -p

  With files downloaded before, generate lacells.db for India:
    ./lacells-creator -i -c404,405 -m

  Generate CSV files for a number of countries:
    ./lacells-creator -i -c605,641,645,748 -e
